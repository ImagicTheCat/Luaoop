Luaoop is a library to do OOP (Object Oriented Programming) which aims to be simple, powerful and optimized (for LuaJIT).

Look at the examples for more understanding of the library.

== Install

Instead of adding the file manually, luarocks can be used:

`luarocks install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImagicTheCat/Luaoop/master/rockspecs/luaoop-scm-2.rockspec`

See link:rockspecs[] and https://luarocks.org/modules/imagicthecat-0a6b669a3a/luaoop[luarocks].

NOTE: It is designed to work with LuaJIT (Lua 5.1), but the code should work on latest versions.

== API

[source,lua]
----
-- create a new class
-- name: identifier for debugging purpose
-- ...: base classes (single/multiple inheritance)
-- return created class
class.new(name, ...)
-- SHORTCUT class(name, ...)

-- t: class or instance
-- return class name or nil
class.name(t)

-- t: instance
-- return the type (class) or nil
class.type(t)

-- check if an instance/class is/inherits from a specific class
-- t: class or instance
-- classdef: can be nil to check if t is a valid (built) class
class.is(t, classdef)

-- return instance/class types map (type => true)
-- t: class or instance
-- return types map (type => true) or nil
class.types(t)

-- works by using tostring(table) address hack or using a counter instead on failure
-- t: instance
-- return unique instance id or nil
class.id(t)

-- t: instance
-- return unique instance data table or nil
class.data(t)

-- get the class metatable applied to the instances
-- useful to apply class behaviour to a custom table
-- will build the class if not already built
-- classdef: class
-- return meta or nil
class.meta(classdef)

-- create instance
-- classdef: class
-- ...: constructor arguments
class.instantiate(classdef, ...)
-- SHORTCUT Class(...)

-- build class
-- will build/re-build the class
-- (if a class is not already built, when used for inheritance or instantiation this function is called)
-- classdef: class
class.build(classdef)

-- get operator
-- lhs: instance
-- name: full name of the operator (starting with "__")
-- rhs: any value, can be nil for unary operators
-- no_error: if passed/true, will not trigger an error if no operator was found
class.getop(lhs, name, rhs, no_error)
----

== Inheritance

* single and multiple inheritance
* all properties are inherited for classes
* all properties except special tables (starting with `__`) are inherited for instances

WARNING: In case of multiple inheritance with functions with the same name, one will be taken arbitrarily. This issue can be solved by accessing directly to a specific parent method/function using the class definition.

Inheritance is not dynamic (cached) and is built by `class.build`. `class.build` must be called for any later changes to the class definition or base classes (in order, build the dependencies, then build the class, then build the derived classes).

NOTE: The function is already called when using a class for inheritance or instantiation for the first time, in most cases calling this function is not needed because the class is completely defined when used. 


.Multiple inheritance
====
[source,lua]
----
A = class("A")
function A:test()
  print("a")
end

B = class("B")
function B:test()
  print("b")
end

C = class("C", A, B) -- inheritance from A and B
function C:test() -- force the usage of B:test()
  B.test(self)
end
----
====

.Overload
====
[source,lua]
----
A = class("A")

function A:__construct()
  print("a")
end

B = class("B", A)
function B:__construct()
  A.__construct(self) -- call parent (A) constructor
  print("b")
end
----
====

== Special methods

Special methods for a class can be defined, they will be overridden the same way other properties are.
Every special method start with `__` (they are not metamethods, they are named like this to keep consistency with the Lua notation).

=== Misc

[horizontal]
construct:: called at initialization
destruct:: called at garbage collection

=== Operators (or things similar)

Operators can be defined like this:
[source,lua]
----
function Object:__op() end -- unary
Object.__op[rhs] = function(self, rhs) end -- binary
----

NOTE: `rhs` can be a class or a Lua type (as string).

.Unary
[horizontal]
call:: like the metamethod
tostring:: like the metamethod
unm:: like the metamethod

.Binary
[horizontal]
concat:: like the metamethod (no order, but has a second parameter "inverse" when the concat is not forward)
add:: like the metamethod (no order)
sub:: like the metamethod (can be omitted if `add` is defined and `unm` is defined for rhs)
mul:: like the metamethod (no order)
div:: like the metamethod
mod:: like the metamethod 
pow:: like the metamethod
eq:: like the metamethod (doesn't throw an error if the operator is missing, will be false by default)
le:: like the metamethod
lt:: like the metamethod

CAUTION: Comparison of different instances with different types is possible, but this may change in the future.

== Private / Protected

There are no private/protected mechanisms in Luaoop.

"Private" methods can be achieved with local functions in the class definition.

"Private" instance properties can be achieved using `class.data`, it can be used to keep some data away from the instance user.

== Behavior transfer

It's possible to give Luaoop class and instance behavior to any object by adding the `luaoop` property (a table) to its metatable (and set some metamethods). 

=== Class behavior

TIP: `class.new` will check (and build if not built) base classes and initializes class special tables. It is easier to use this function and copy/modify the metatable afterwards.

.Base properties
[horizontal]
name:: class name
bases:: list of base classes

Optional build hooks can be added to customize some parts of the build process, they are functions starting with `__`.

.Build hooks
[horizontal]
postbuild(class, build):: used to add more properties to the build, called after the base classes inheritance process
postmeta(class, meta):: used to modify the built instance metatable, called at the end of the build process

.After-build properties
[horizontal]
build:: table containing inherited properties and special tables for the class
instance_build:: table containing inherited properties without special tables (merged with class properties)
types:: map of type (class) => true
meta:: metatable built used for the instances
+
====
.Base properties
[horizontal]
type:: instance type
types:: map of type (class) => true
name:: base class name

Optional hooks can be added to customize the instances behavior, they are functions starting with `__`.

.Hooks
[horizontal]
data(instance):: should return the instance datatable
id(instance):: should return the instance id (number)

.Metamethods
[horizontal]
index:: inherits from class `instance_build`
call:: op call
unm:: op unm
add:: op add
sub:: op sub
mul:: op mul
div:: op div
pow:: op pow
mod:: op mod
eq:: op eq
le:: op le
lt:: op lt
tostring:: op tostring
concat:: op concat
====

NOTE: It's easier to let these properties being created by `class.build` and just implement the build hooks.

.Metamethods
[horizontal]
call:: shortcut for `class.instantiate`
tostring:: for regular classes, will print `class<name>`
index:: inherits from the `build` table and each special tables inherit from `build` special tables

=== Instance behavior

The instance behavior is set using the `meta` built metatable. If `data` or `id` hooks are not set, this metatable could be replaced by a copy (not deep) to have custom fields (to store data and id). 

TIP: The new metatable would be marked as custom with a `luaoop.custom` boolean property set to true.

== CClass (LuaJIT)

Luaoop also have a `cclass` module to create "C-like FFI interface class", taking advange of the FFI metatype of LuaJIT.

This is a completely different module and none of the functions of `class` are related to `cclass`. 

It is following the Luaoop style.

=== API

[source,lua]
----
-- change the symbols dict for the following created cclass (ffi.C by default)
cclass.symbols(symbols)

-- create C-like FFI class
-- name: name of the class, used to define the cdata type and the functions prefix
-- statics: static functions exposed to the class object, special functions are exposed by default
-- methods: methods exposed to the instances, special methods are overridden
-- ...: inherited bases cclass 
cclass.new(name, statics, methods, ...)
-- SHORTCUT cclass(...)
----

==== Used statics

[horizontal]
new:: should return a new heap instance of the cclass
delete:: should free the instance pointer
cast_Base:: should return a valid casted pointer of the passed instance to the base type

==== Special statics

[horizontal]
name:: return the class name

==== Special methods

Special methods override the cclass methods, they all start by `__`.

[horizontal]
id:: return the instance id (intptr address)
type:: return the type of the instance as a string
instanceof(stype):: check if the instance is based on the passed type (as string)
cast(stype):: return up-casted version of the instance in the passed type (as string)
c_...:: call the C method `...`
s_...:: call the super method `...`
s_Base_...:: call the super method `...` for a specific base class
get(member):: get the member function of the given name (cdata throw an error when a nil member is accessed)
data:: return the datatable associated to this instance (per type, a cast from this instance will give a different datatable)

=== Usage

* the name will be used as a FFI symbol prefix
* `statics` and `methods` contain mapped lua functions or `true` to bind the C function 
* in case of overloading with a lua function, the C function can be retrieved using `__c_function_name`
* in case of overloading of a base class method, it can be retrieved using  `__s_function_name` or in a more specific way `__s_Base_function_name` (super)
* statics are not inherited and are only availables from the class object
* Luaoop style operators are availables (allow to directly implement the operators in C)
* the `cclass` constructor will call `new` and bind the `delete` to `ffi.gc`, so new and delete are expected to manage heap memory, but having a `new/delete` is not required, any way used to obtain a valid cdata will allow the use of the methods (thanks to FFI metatypes)
* multiple inheritances is possible, but remember that LuaJIT can't know how C++ cast multiple inherited pointer types so using them will result in undefined behavior, `cclass` based on C++ inherited interface (with multiple inheritances) should define the static `cast_Base` function to generate a valid pointer casted to the base class type (it's also possible to overload the base methods in C and cast the pointer here, giving more control but losing the interest of having `cclass` inheritance)
* only up-cast is available, casting an instance back to a child class is not allowed (it's possible using ffi.cast, but this can result in undefined behavior, like a `A*` -> `void*` -> `B*`)
* a cclass instance (cdata instance) should be safe to handle as long as pointers are valid and checked to be not null in methods

.2D vector behavior
====
[source,lua]
----
-- adding behavior to a struct

ffi.cdef([[
typedef struct{
  int x;
  int y;
} Vec2;
]])

-- get cdata constructor
local ct_Vec2 = ffi.typeof("Vec2")

-- define the type methods
local Vec2 = cclass("Vec2", {}, {
  __mul_number = function(self, rhs) 
    local v = ct_Vec2()
    v.x = self.x*rhs
    v.y = self.y*rhs

    return v
  end,
  __tostring = function(self)
    return "("..self.x..","..self.y..")"
  end
})

-- create Vec2 instance using the ctype

local vec = ct_Vec2()
vec.x = 1
vec.y = 2
print(vec*10) -- "(10,20)"
